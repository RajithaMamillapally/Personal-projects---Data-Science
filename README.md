# Personal projects --- Data Science
This Repository consists of Projects done by me.Projects are presented in the form of Google colab notebooks<br>
## Instructions for running Python Notebooks Locally
Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.<br>
## Contents
### Machine Learning:
#### Supervised Learning:
[Banking default prediction](https://github.com/RajithaMamillapally/Personal-projects---Data-Science/blob/main/Banking%20default%20prediction/Banking%20default%20prediction.ipynb):A predictive model to predict the probability of defualt of credit card.<br>

[Life Insurance](https://github.com/RajithaMamillapally/Personal-projects---Data-Science/blob/main/Life%20Insurance/Insurance.ipynb): A predictive model to predict the 
bonus for its agents so that it may design appropriate engagement activity for their high performing agents and upskill programs for low performing agents
